# 🛡️ SOC Home Lab — Network Visibility & Automation

**Goal:** Tie network activity, endpoint logs, and basic automation into a single, understandable SOC workflow.

---

## 🧭 Project Phases

This lab is structured into progressive phases to mirror how a SOC environment is built and reasoned about:

- **Phase 0:** Assumed security baseline (not the focus)
- **Phase 1:** Network mapping and baseline creation
- **Phase 2:** Log collection and centralization using a SIEM (Splunk)
- **Phase 3:** Detection, correlation, and dashboarding
- **Phase 4:** Network change awareness and validation
- **Phase 5:** Minimal automation using Python
- **Phase 6:** SOC analyst-style reporting and conclusions

## 🔍 Guiding Questions

The lab is built around key questions a SOC analyst would ask:

- If something changes on the network, would I notice?
- Can raw logs be turned into actionable security signals?
- If an employer skimmed this in 60 seconds, would they understand my thinking?

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Splunk Enterprise & Universal Forwarder**
- **Windows & Linux Event Logs**
- **Python (for minimal automation)**
- Network scanning tools (e.g., Nmap)
- Virtualized environments (VMware, VirtualBox, or similar)
